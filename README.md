I clicked 'fork' in the upper right of the index.sbolstandard.org
repo, and then enter a couple times to a popup I don't remember.
Something about where I wanted to put the fork, and I picked my
username. Then I cloned pulled and pushed the code like usual to
change things. The last step was to go to my forked version and click
'Pull Request' in the upper right. There was a form with a title and
message box, and it automatically made the issue from that too.
